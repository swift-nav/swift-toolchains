# Overview of Swift Toolchains

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swift-nav/llvm-obfuscator-arm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swift-nav/llvm-obfuscator-arm)

This collection of toolchains includes several things:

- A build of LLVM 6 for ARM and x64 for use within Buildroot to run clang-tidy (and friends)
- An abfuscating compiler for ARM using https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator
- GCC arm-eabi-none toolchains for "bare metal" builds

# Example usage of LLVM packages in Buildroot

To integrate with with Buildroot, see the examples in [piksi_buildroot](https://github.com/swift-nav/piksi_buildroot):
- [llvm_obfuscator.mk](https://github.com/swift-nav/piksi_buildroot/blob/v2.2.0-release/package/llvm_obfuscator/llvm_obfuscator.mk)
- [llvm_vanilla.mk](https://github.com/swift-nav/piksi_buildroot/blob/v2.2.0-release/package/llvm_vanilla/llvm_vanilla.mk)

# Piksi Firmware Toolchain
The Piksi Firmware toolchains are mirrored in the releases for this repo. When these are updated the instructions in the Piksi Firmware repository should be updated, along with any installation tools (i.e. Mac Homebrew formulas).
